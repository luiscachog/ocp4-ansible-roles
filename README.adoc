= Deploy Operator role

== Purpose

To provide reusable automation to run ansible plays against OpenShift 4 clusters

. Create repository secret in GitHub Settings > Secrets called KUBECONFIG that contains kubeconfig details
. Add any addition modules to requirements.txt with `openshift` listed
. Add ansible playbook called main.yaml
.. Ensure playbook has *vars* for `ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3`

Once the main branch is pushed with updates to main.yaml the workflow will trigger the actions that will run *ansible-playbook*.

This is intended to simulate running Ansible playbooks to engineer, operate, or manage OpenShift 4 clusters on a bastion host.  The playbook is intended to run locally on runner and use  either `oc`, `kubectl`, or other modules that interact with OpenShift APIs or any APIs.
