== Purpose

To provide reusable automation to run ansible plays and roles against OpenShift 4 clusters

NOTE: This will always pull the latest *stable* OpenShift 4 CLI tools

== Roles

* Add any addition modules to requirements.txt with `openshift` listed

=== Deploy-Operator

. Create repository secret in GitHub Settings > Secrets called KUBECONFIG that contains kubeconfig details
. Update ansible playbook called main.yaml
.. Ensure playbook has *vars* for `ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3`
.. Add operator name and namespace *vars*

Once the main branch is pushed with updates to main.yaml the workflow will trigger the actions that will run *ansible-playbook*.

This is intended to simulate running Ansible playbooks to engineer, operate, or manage OpenShift 4 clusters on a bastion host.  The playbook is intended to run locally on runner and use  either `oc`, `kubectl`, or other modules that interact with OpenShift APIs or any APIs.
